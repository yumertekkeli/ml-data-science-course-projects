# ml-data-science-course-projects
In this repo, I'd like to present you some of the projects that I did meanwhile taking Jose Portilla's 2022 Python for Machine Learning and Data Science Masterclass.

The folders are named with the contents of the course, each one contains project exercise notebooks related to the subject.
